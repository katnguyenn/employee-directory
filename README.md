# employee-directory

## Description

Using React, I created an employee directory for quick access to  information, including:

* Image
* Name
* Phone Number
* Email
* Date of Birth (DOB)

Users can search a particular name or sort the names either in ascending or descending order.

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees.
